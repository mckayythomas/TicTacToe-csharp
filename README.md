# Overview

In this project, I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game using C# to enhance my skills as a software engineer. The primary purpose of this project was to demonstrate proficiency in C# language syntax, object-oriented programming concepts, and graphical user interface (GUI) development in Windows Forms.

# Development Environment

I utilized Visual Studio as my primary integrated development environment (IDE) for building the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Visual Studio provides a comprehensive set of tools for C# development, including a powerful code editor, debugging features, and a drag-and-drop GUI designer for Windows Forms.

# Programming Language and Libraries

The project was implemented in C#, a versatile and object-oriented programming language designed for building Windows applications. Windows Forms was used for creating the graphical user interface, and standard libraries such as System and System.Windows.Forms were leveraged to handle various functionalities within the application.

# Future Work

- **Refactor Code:** Optimize and refactor the codebase for better maintainability and readability. Include other classes for players and messages.
- **Improve UI:** Enhance the visual appeal of the user interface with better design and layout. Include info windows on game win or game end.
- **Add Score History** Add writing the final score to a text file to keep track of wins between players with timestamps.
